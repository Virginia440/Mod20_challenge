## Software Control Version

Remix IDE

Remix - Ethereum IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.



## Overview of the analysis

* Purpose of the analysis

Create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Project Steps
Step 1: Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

Step 2: Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
Step 3: Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

## Results

Compile the contract
